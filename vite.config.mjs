/**
 * Library build: one source, three formats.
 *
 * There was no JS build at all. `dist/ichava-motion.js` was a byte-identical hand copy of
 * `src/ichava-motion.js`, so the only artifact shipped was the IIFE, while `exports`
 * advertised `require` support the package could not honour and no ESM entry existed.
 *
 * The IIFE keeps the `IchavaMotion` global and the historical filename, so existing
 * `<script src="dist/ichava-motion.js">` tags and every CDN URL already published keep
 * working. ESM and CJS are new files rather than replacements for that reason.
